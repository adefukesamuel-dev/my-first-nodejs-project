**VERSION CONTROL (GIT) AND GITHUB**

1.  **Introduction to Version Control Version Control** is a system that helps developers track and manage changes to source code over time.It allows teams to collaborate efficiently, prevent data loss, and maintain a complete history of changes.Key Benefits:‚Ä¢ Tracks every change made to the codebase.‚Ä¢ Allows developers to revert to previous versions if necessary.‚Ä¢ Enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.‚Ä¢ Facilitates collaboration and code review.

**There are two types:**

1.  **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)** ‚Äì e.g., Subversion (SVN) A single central server stores all versions. Risk: If the server fails, everything may be lost.
2.  **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** ‚Äì e.g., Git Every developer has a full copy of the repository on their machine. Safer and more flexible than CVCS.

üîπ 2. What is Git?Git is an open-source Distributed Version Control System created by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux) in 2005.It tracks changes in source code, supports non-linear workflows, and allows developers to collaborate efficiently.

**Key Git Concept****s**:

-   **Concept Description Repository (Repo):** The project folder that Git tracks. It contains all project files and history.¬†
-   **Commit:** A snapshot of your project‚Äôs files at a specific point in time.
-   **Branch:** A separate line of development that allows you to work independently from the main code.Merge Combines changes from one branch into another.
-   **Clone**: Creates a copy of a repository from a remote source (e.g., GitHub).Push Sends your local commits to a remote repository.
-   **Pull:** Fetches and merges updates from a remote repository into your local copy.¬†
-   **Staging Area:** A temporary area where you prepare changes before committing.

Git WorkflowThe Git workflow typically follows this sequence:

3.  Initialize a repository***git init*** (Creates a .git folder to start tracking your project.)
4.  Check the status of files***git status***
5.  Add files to staging

# Version Control (Git) and GitHub ‚Äî Teaching Guide

This document is a compact, student-friendly guide covering core Git concepts, common commands, branching workflows, conflict resolution, and a short set of assignments.

## 1 ‚Äî Why version control?

-   **‚Äã**Tracks every change to your codebase
-   Lets you revert to previous states
-   Enables safe collaboration between multiple developers
-   Keeps a history and context for why changes were made

## 2 ‚Äî Core concepts

-   **Repository (repo):** the project folder Git tracks, including history
-   **Commit: a** snapshot of your files with a message
-   **Branch:** an independent line of development
-   **Staging area (index):** where you prepare files before committing
-   **Remote:** a hosted copy of the repo (e.g. GitHub)

## 3 ‚Äî Quick reference: essential commands

-   Initialize repo: `git init`
-   Check status: `git status`
-   Stage a file: `git add <file>` (or `git add .` to stage all)
-   Commit staged changes: `git commit -m "meaningful message"`
-   Show branches: `git branch`
-   Create & switch branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
-   Switch branch: `git checkout main`
-   Merge branch into current: `git merge feature-name`
-   Fetch remote updates: `git fetch origin`
-   Pull (fetch + merge): `git pull origin main`
-   Push branch: `git push origin feature-name`
-   Set upstream (first push): `git push -u origin feature-name`

## 4 ‚Äî Branching workflow (recommended)

1.  Update your local main:
    -   `git checkout main`
    -   `git pull origin main`
2.  Create a feature branch:
    -   `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3.  Make small, focused commits:
    -   `git add` + `git commit -m "feat: short description"`
4.  Keep your branch up to date (merge or rebase):
    -   Merge: `git fetch origin` then `git merge origin/main`
    -   Rebase: `git fetch origin` then `git rebase origin/main`
5.  Push and create a Pull Request (PR):
    -   `git push -u origin feature/my-feature`
    -   Open PR on GitHub and request review

## 5 ‚Äî Merge vs Rebase (short)

-   **Merge:** preserves commit history and adds a merge commit. Safe for shared branches.
-   **Rebase**: creates a linear history by replaying commits on top of main. Cleaner but rewrites history ‚Äî avoid rebasing shared branches.

## 6 ‚Äî Conflict resolution (practical steps)

1.  Git will stop and mark conflicted files with markers:
    
    ```
    <<<<<<< HEAD// your current branch version=======// the incoming branch version>>>>>>> feature-branch
    ```
    
2.  Edit the file to keep the correct code.
    
3.  Stage the resolved file: `git add <file>`
    
4.  Continue the operation:
    
    -   If merging: `git commit` (if needed)
    -   If rebasing: `git rebase --continue`

## 7 ‚Äî GitHub workflow

-   Create repo on GitHub and clone: `git clone <url>`
-   Develop in feature branches and open PRs for review
-   Use protected branches for `main` and require PRs for merging
-   Use Actions for CI (run tests on PRs)

## 8 ‚Äî VS Code tips

-   Built-in Source Control view shows changed files and branches
-   Use GitLens or Git Graph extensions for visual history
-   Use the terminal inside VS Code for exact commands when teaching

## 9 ‚Äî Authentication

-   GitHub uses Personal Access Tokens (PATs) instead of passwords.
-   On Windows, use the Credential Manager or `git credential-manager` to store tokens.

## 10 ‚Äî Classroom assignments (short)

Assignment A ‚Äî Basic branch flow

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Create branch `feature-readme`.
3.  Edit `README.md`, commit, and push the branch.
4.  Open a Pull Request and merge.

Assignment B ‚Äî Branching and merging practice

1.  Create branches `feature-intro` and `feature-hobby` from `main`.
2.  Add `intro.txt` and `hobby.txt` respectively and commit.
3.  Merge both branches back into `main` (resolve any conflicts).
4.  Push all branches to GitHub.

Bonus (optional):

-   Create `bugfix-typo`, make a small typo fix, then rebase onto `main` and push.

## 11 ‚Äî Quick cheat sheet (copyable)

```bash
# create & switch to branchgit checkout -b feature/example# make changesgit add .git commit -m "feat: short description"# keep updated with main (merge)git fetch origingit merge origin/main# or (rebase)git fetch origingit rebase origin/main# push branchgit push -u origin feature/example
```

If you want, I can:

-   Commit this updated `version control.md` for you and push it to `feature-password-reset`.
-   Produce a printable handout or a short slide deck for your students.

2.  Generate a new token with ‚Äúrepo‚Äù permissions.
